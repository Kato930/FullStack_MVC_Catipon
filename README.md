This project, titled Vector Vault, is a web application built using the Model View Controller MVC framework to demonstrate a more professional and organized approach to full stack development. Unlike my previous assignments, I have separated the code into specific folders config, controllers, models, and views to ensure that the database logic, the backend processing, and the user interface are kept distinct and manageable. The index.php file in the main folder serves as the central router, handling all user requests and directing them to the appropriate controller. For security reasons, I have not included the user_system.sql file in this GitHub repository and have instead submitted it directly via Microsoft Teams; please import that file into XAMPP to create the necessary database and users table. I have verified that the connection in config/db.php is fully functional by testing the registration and login flow across all four required pages, ensuring that the system successfully handles data from start to finish.
