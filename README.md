This is my Vector Vault project, which I built using the MVC framework to make the code more organized than my previous assignments. I have separated the project into config, controllers, models, and views folders so that the database connection, the backend logic, and the user interface are all in their own places. The index.php file in the main folder acts as the router to make sure everything loads correctly when you click through the four different pages. For the design, I used Tailwind CSS to give it a stylized "Vector" look with orange and dark blue colors, including a custom logo that fits the theme. Because my friend said it was a security risk, I am not putting the user_system.sql file on GitHub and have instead submitted it directly through Microsoft Teams. Please import that .sql file into your XAMPP phpMyAdmin to create the user_system database and the users table so you can test the login and registration forms.
